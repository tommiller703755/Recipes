        <h1>Ramen</h1>
        <p>Like college students everywhere, I LIVED on ramen all through college, and still regularly make it for lunch. However, regular instant ramen isn't all that good, and lacks nutritional value, so I started spicing it up (literally in some cases), experimenting until I had it just how I liked it.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The best part of this meal is how adaptable and customizable it is. I've included my favorite ingredients in this recipe, but these can very easily be swapped for other proteins, sauces, and toppings. I've made this recipe with shrimp, brisket, grilled chicken, leftover stir fry vegetables, and pretty much anything else I had in my fridge, and it came out great every time. Play with this recipe and make it your own, and leave a comment about how you've customized it!</p>
