        <h1>Lemon Veggie Pasta</h1>
        <p>The first Christmas I spent with my girlfriend's family was an unusual experience to ssay the least, involving light up pajama pants, chocolate cake shots, a kickball, and a Christmas lasagna. Her family isn't italian, but you wouldn't be able to tell that from how they cook.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As I helped prepate this lasagna, I learned her family's tips and tricks for this recipe. Of these, the most critical were to sprinkle herbs on top, always use Italian sausage, and to prepare the lasagna the day before you bake it.</p>
        <bt>
        <p>This last tip is the true beauty of the recipe. If the lasagna is left to sit in the fridge overnight, the flavors of eack layer will meld together beautifully. This also works in a freezer, so you can make this well before you'll need it and keep is stashed away.</p>
