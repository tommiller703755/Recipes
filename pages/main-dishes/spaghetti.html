        <h1>Spaghetti</h1>
        <p>There are few things in this world my girtlfriend loves more than spaghetti, so it became a pretty regular meal in our household after we moved in together. Her recipe was goos, but she thought it could be better, we we embarked on a quest to perfect it.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This required a lot of trial and error with different techniques and ingredients, but eventually we got it to just about perfect. Our secret is the "garlic mash," that gets thrown into the sauce right at the very end. Waiting to add the garlic and herbs until the very end allows those flavors to really shine in this sauce, making it much more flavorful than it would be otherwise.</p>
