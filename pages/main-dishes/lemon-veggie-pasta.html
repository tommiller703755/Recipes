            <li>1 cup of preserved pasta water</li>
            <li>1 small red onion, diced</li>
            <li>¼ cup of lemon juice (or about 1-2 lemons)</li>
            <li>1½ teaspoons of fresh thyme (or ½ teaspoon dry thyme)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of finely chopped fresh oregano (or 1 teaspoon of dry oregano)</li>
            <li>¼ cup of fresh parsley, chopped</li>
            <li>¼ cup of fresh basil, chopped</li>

            <h4>Garnish (optional)</h4>
            <li>Freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>Crumbled bacon</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 1:</h4>
                <p><b>Roasted Vegetables: </b>Preheat the oven to 400°F. In a medium bowl, toss vegetables and garlic with olive oil, sugar, salt and pepper until well combined (there will be a generous amount of oil - this will transfer to the pasta later). Spread vegetables on a baking sheet lined with a slip mat or parchment paper. Roast for 15 minutes or until asparagus is crisp-tender.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 2:</h4>
                <p><b>Pasta: </b>Meanwhile, cook pasta al denta in generously salted water. Drain and reserve 1 cup of pasta water. Add the pasta to a very large mixing bowl or pot.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 3:</h4>
                <p><b>Chicken: </b>Meanwhile, remove chicken from marinade and proceed to grill chicken or cook indoors by heating 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a nonstick skillet over medium high heat. Add chicken and cook for 3-5 minutes or until well browned on one side. Flip the chicken over, reduce heat to medium, cover and cook an for additional 5-7 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through (time will depend on the chicken's thickness). Remove it to a cutting board to rest for 5 minutes before slicing.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 4:</h4>
                <p><b>Assemble: </b>Add the red onion to the same skillet the chicken was cooked in (add additional olive oil if necessary). Saute onions over medium heat until soft and translucent, approximately 5 minutes. Remove the red onion to cooked pasta, along with thyme, oregano, parsley, basil, lemon juice, and roasted vegetables. Toss to combine. Add the pasta water from earlier (a little at a time) to reach the desired consistency. Taste and add additional salt and pepper, and red pepper is desired.</p>
