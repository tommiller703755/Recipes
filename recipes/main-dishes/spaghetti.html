        <h1>Spaghetti</h1>

        <img src="../../images/spaghetti.jpg" alt="Picture of a plate of spaghetti.">

        <p>There are few things in this world my girlfriend loves more than spaghetti, so it became a pretty regular meal in our household after we moved in together. Her recipe was good, but she thought it could be better, we we embarked on a quest to perfect it.</p>
        <p>This required a lot of trial and error with different techniques and ingredients, but eventually we got it to just about perfect. Our secret is the "garlic mash," that gets thrown into the sauce right at the very end. Waiting to add the garlic and herbs until the very end allows those flavors to really shine in this sauce, making it much more flavorful than it would be otherwise.</p>
        <p>This recipe will be focusing on the spaghetti sauce, we won't be touching on the noodles here. That means that you can use this recipe for anything that requires a delicious and meaty red sauce.</p>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 1:</h4>
                <p>Chop all the ingredients and set them to the side for now.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 2:</h4>
                <p>Mix the spices, herbs and garlic into a mortar and pestle with some olive oil. Mix until it's a smooth paste, before setting this aside for now.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 3:</h4>
                <p>Brown the italian sausage in a pan with some olive oil. Once it's cooked all the way through remove it with a spatulla and set it to the side for now.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 4:</h4>
                <p>Cook the chopped onions in the sausage grease before also removing this to a bowl to the side.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 5:</h4>
                <p>Cook the mushrooms in the pan until they're dark brown. Add more olive oil if needed. Once again, remove them from the pan and set them to the side.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 6:</h4>
                <p>Fry the tomato paste in the olive oil, before removing it as well.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 7:</h4>
                <p>Deglaze the pan with a red wine to get all the crispy bits from cooking the ingredients so far.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 8:</h4>
                <p>Dump all the ingredients cooked earlier back into the pan with the red wine deglaze, along with the can of whole tomatoes, fire roasted tomatos and stir thoroughly. I find it best to crush the whole tomatoes at this stage.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 9:</h4>
                <p>Nestle the parm rind into the sauce and let the whole thing cook on low for a good long while (this is difficult to overcook).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 10:</h4>
                <p>Add the garlic paste from earlier and let it cook for just a few more minutes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Step 11:</h4>
                <p>Serve and enjoy.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
