        <p>Like college students everywhere, I LIVED on ramen all through college, and still regularly make it for lunch. However, regular instant ramen isn't all that good, and lacks nutritional value, so I started spicing it up (literally in some cases), experimenting until I had it just how I liked it.</p>
        <p>The best part of this meal is how adaptable and customizable it is. I've included my favorite ingredients in this recipe, but these can very easily be swapped for other proteins, sauces, and toppings. I've made this recipe with shrimp, brisket, grilled chicken, leftover stir fry vegetables, and pretty much anything else I had in my fridge, and it came out great every time. Play with this recipe and make it your own, and leave a comment about how you've customized it!</p>

                <li>
                    <h4>Step 1:</h4>
                    <p>Mince the garlic, chives and summer sausage and set them aside for now.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Step 2:</h4>
                    <p>Break the eggs into a cup and wisk them with a fork, set this aside for now.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Step 3:</h4>
                    <p>Bring a pot of water to a low boil, adding the noodles once the water is boiling.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Step 4:</h4>
                    <p>Break apart the noodle brick with a spoon to make sure they soften quickly and nicely. If you want to use the flavoring packet that came with the ramen, now would be the ideal time.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Step 5:</h4>
                    <p>Once the noodles have begun to soften you can mix in what you chopped earlier, along with the eggs.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Step 5:</h4>
                    <p>Let it boil a bit longer before taking it off heat, and serving straight away, it's best hot!</p>
