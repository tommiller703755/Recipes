        <img src="../../images/azafroth.jpeg" alt="Picture of a green caffeinated cocktail.">

        <p>Here we have a drink themed around Azathoth, one of the deities from H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos. I've been a fan of the Cthulhu Mythos and the themes of cosmic horror it pioneered for a very long time, so when I saw this drink I knew I had to include it</p>
        <p>Funnily enough despite being named after a deity best known for sleeping, this drink is certain to keep you up, with two full tablespoons of espresso, and three ounces of coffee liqueur.</p>
