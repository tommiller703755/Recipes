        <img src="../../images/garlic-bread.jpeg" alt="A plate of garlic bread.">

        <p>Garlic bread is the ultimate comfort food, perfectly combining crispy, buttery toast with the rich, aromatic flavors of roasted garlic and fresh herbs. A golden-brown crust gives way to a soft, pillowy interior, while a generous spread of garlic butter — often accented with parsley, oregano, and a hint of parmesan — elevates every bite. Whether served as a side dish, appetizer, or snack, garlic bread’s irresistible aroma and satisfying crunch make it a crowd-pleaser at any meal. Best enjoyed fresh from the oven, it's the perfect pairing with pasta, salads, or a hearty soup, transforming any meal into a cozy, flavor-packed experience.</p>
